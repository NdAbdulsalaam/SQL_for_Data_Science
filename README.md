</h1>

This repository contains solutions to **coding exercises** in the course mentioned above.

:mailbox_with_mail: 
- All the codes were tested and passed on coursera.
- The course uses SQLite, so I choose it.
- If you find any error or face any issue, let me know through issue section
- The questions are as presented exactly in the course without any modification
- The table names, however, take 's' at the end if they were to be queried on Coursera
- If you don't find any solution to the practice quiz or module assessment, open an issue including the problem description and the week number. :fire:
